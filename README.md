Eela Audio Logos mixstation

I am making a public download and guide available to keep this great little machine alive in the modern age.
As a lot of Eela Audio got sold off, a lot has been lost regarding software and documentation.
Firmware used to be send out to you. There was never a public download page for firmware and software.

Manual A is the standard operation manual.
I am still ooking for Manual B, which has more deeper hardware diagnostic inside of it.
Credits to the working manual to https://interstage.dk/Sider/Produkter/Brochure_manual/Eela/Eela_Logos_man.pdf

Using Windows 95:
Oracle VM with 95/98 - able to download and upload config, but not successful to firmware upgrade to Main V1.41 from V1.28
Create an ISO from the files inside the ZIP and mount it as CD inside windows 95/98. Install software.
Make sure you hook the correct COM port!

I assume that it's way easier to have a machine actually running Wind95/98.

Using Windows 10 (or newer):
Software does open, but unable to connect to device.

To install configuration software LogosTool on Windows 11, you need this tool to open 16-bit old Windows software. LogosTool itself is a 32bit program. So you just need it for the installer:

Will update if I find a way to firmware upgrade.
